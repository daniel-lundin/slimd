# Top level headline


Test med lite *feta* ord

## A sub-headline

En lista: 

  - Fast execution times by running tests in parallel
  - Agnostic towards assertion libraries, as long as exceptions are thrown or promises returned.
  - Small API, few features, little configuration

## Another sub-headline


```js
import code from 'covfefe';

code.init({
  suspect: true,
  params: [1,2,3,4]
});
```
